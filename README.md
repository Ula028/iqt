# Image Quality Transfer

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a form of MR imaging that can be used to noninvasively and indirectly assess tissue macro and microstructure. It has applications in many fields, including the identification of brain tumours, the evaluation of dementia disorders and the assessment of structural damage in traumatic brain injuries.

This project aims to explore the potential benefits of using the image quality transfer (IQT) technique in dMRI. IQT uses machine learning to transfer information from high-quality images obtained using the most advanced scanning procedures to low-quality images often acquired in clinical practice. This increases the usability of the obtained data and enables the use of more sophisticated analytical techniques that usually require images with high spatial resolution.
